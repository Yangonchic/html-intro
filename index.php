                    <p align="justify">Software provider of back-office broker’s clearing and settlement system called SUMMIT. SUMMIT is a broker client accounting system covering the full transaction lifecycle from order capture to settlement processing of equity securities in the Australian markets. SUMMIT supports the retail, institutional and principal trading activities of a brokerage firm.

SUMMIT solution was developed originally by FMSC where I was one of eight developers who worked on the product. The product took over four years to complete. FMSC was taken over by Computershare in mid 1997. In the early 2001, the SUMMIT product was sold to ADP-Wilco. 
  
SUMMIT database schema was quite complex. It had over 600 tables and 1200 relationships, 3000 stored procedures. Most of the processes like trade, order and contract creation processes and settlement of cash and stocks, and interface to CHESS, SEATS and banks were automated. It’s a client/server application with thin client and fat server where most of the business logics were embedded in the stored procedures. The client side application was written initially in Visual Basic 3(VB) then converted to VB 6. The back-end database was initially a SYBASE 4.9 server but later converted to SQL Server 6.5 in 1997, and then to SQL Server 2000 in 2001. All SUMMIT clients now run on SQL Server 2000 in production environment. The reports in SUMMIT were written using Crystal Report Professional. The SUMMIT Scheduler and gateways to external interface like CHESS and SEATS and financial institution were written using C and C++ .

SUMMIT product has been deployed at Westpac, and E*Trade, and the Institutional division of ABN Amro. The first installation was at E*Trade and it has now been running SUMMIT for over seven years.
